git diff --cached

# 3. Compare working directory with the last commit: Includes staged and unstaged changes.
git diff HEAD

# 4. Compare specific branches: Identify changes between two branches.
git diff branch1 branch2

# 5. Compare specific commits: Analyze differences between two commits.
git diff commit1 commit2

# 6. Compare a commit with the working directory: View changes since a specific commit.
git diff commit_id

# 7. Compare a commit with the staging area: Check differences between staged state and a previous commit.
git diff --staged commit_id

# 8. Compare a specific file in the working directory.
git diff path/to/file

# 9. Compare a file between two branches: Analyze file-specific changes across branches.
git diff branch1 branch2 -- path/to/file

# 10. Show word-level changes: Highlights changes at the word level.
git diff --word-diff

# 11. Ignore whitespace changes: Focus on meaningful code changes.
git diff -w

# 12. Show stat summary of changes: Displays a summary of added/removed lines per file.
git diff --stat

# 13. Show unified diff with context: Adjust the number of context lines around changes.
git diff -U<n>
# Example: Shows 3 lines of context.
git diff -U3

# 14. Output diff in patch format: Creates patch-like diff output.
git diff --patch

# 15. View differences between tags: Analyze changes between release versions.
git diff tag1 tag2

# 16. Show diff summary for renames: Summarizes structural changes like renames and deletions.
git diff --summary

# 17. Name-only changes: Lists names of changed files without showing the actual diff.
git diff --name-only

# 18. Name-status changes: Lists changed files along with their status (added/modified/deleted).
git diff --name-status

# 19. Diff with external tool: Opens an external diff tool for a visual comparison.

# 20. Check untracked files: Compares two untracked files or directories.
git diff --no-index file1 file2

# 21. Limit output to a specific author: Analyze changes made by one author.
git diff --author="Author Name"

# 22. Show diff of a range of commits: Compare a series of commits.
git diff commit1..commit2

# 23. Show diff in color: Ensures diff output is colored, even when piped.
git diff --color

# 24. Reverse diff: Displays the diff in reverse (swaps additions and deletions).
git diff -R

# Example Alias for Convenience:
# Add the following to your .gitconfig for quick access.
[alias]
    d = diff --stat --color  # Basic diff with stats and color.
    ds = diff --staged --stat --color  # Staged diff with stats and color.
    dl = diff --name-only --color  # Name-only diff with color.
